=== About
This repository is for Player drivers I'm working on that aren't quite
ready to be submitted upstream.  They may, however, still be useful to some
people, so they're available.

=== License
Unless otherwise specified, all drivers are made available under the 
terms of the GNU GPL v2 (or later) license.
